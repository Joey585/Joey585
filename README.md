Hello, my name is Joey.

I am 16, Junior in highschool.

I've been programming for about 2 years, I may be a beginner year-wise but I have a lot of progress on learning Java, Javascript, front-end languages, Python. 
I am currently developing for VoidedSky, a minecraft server with big dreams.
I want to go to college for Computer Science.
I am a freelancer at DevRoom, a place where you can order discord bots, minecraft plugins, minecraft builds, 3d models, etc.

I bought a Flipper Zero and an arduino starter kit to learn more about electrical engineering, as it is a very interesting subject.

You can contact me on joey585official@gmail.com for any buisness related opportunities <i>Just in case ;)</i>
Or if you wanna chat, hit me up on discord: Joey585#0585
